### Hi there 👋

I'm Kolja from Europe and I am doing software for living. I'm mainly interested in new ways to build "programming" languages for people who wouldn't consider them self programmers. Feel free to ask me anything about domain specific languages, language workbenches, (programming) language design or how to teach people to build their own languages. Just drop me a message! I'm currently learning a lot about web technologies especially interactive editors.
