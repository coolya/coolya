I'm Kolja from Europe and I am doing software for living. I'm mainly interested in new ways to build "programming" languages for people who wouldn't consider them self programmers. I'm a maintainer for MPS-Extensions and mbeddr. Apart from that I'm currently looking into how to bring language workbenches to the web. If you are interested in this take a look at [modelix](https://github.com/modelix/). Feel free to ask me anything about domain specific languages, language workbenches, (programming) language design or how to teach people to build their own languages. Just drop me a message! I'm currently learning a lot about web technologies especially interactive editors.
